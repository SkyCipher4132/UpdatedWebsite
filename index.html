I'm Sky Cipher, by the way... <b>I am happy</b> that you have found my <i>special</i> website!</p><h2>Basic Lore:</h2><ul><li>Name: Sky Cipher</li><li>Age: 1 trillion years old.</li><li>Parents: Euclid Cipher, Scalene Cipher</li><li>Siblings: Bill Cipher</li><li>Origin: Euclydia</li><li>Current Location: Your home dimension, aka my new home dimension</li></ul><h2>My Lore (EXPANDED):</h2><ul><li> About a trillion years ago, there lived a happy 2nd dimension called Euclydia. There lived two triangles; Euclid and Scalene. One day, they had kids. It's that simple. Instead of having an only child, they had twins. Bill Cipher and Sky Cipher. The two children had rare eye defects that allowed them to see sacred dimensions called "up" and "down".</li><li>Sky wanted to leave the confines of the pancake reality, but her brother had other plans. Bill wanted to destroy his dimension to escape it, rather than following Sky's method of rotating into 3D.</li><li>Sky tried to stop him but was launched by Bill past the world, as Sky then landed in Lottocron 9, the Gambling Dimension.</li><li>Then, when Bill discovered Earth, Sky followed him and gave all the humans warning signs of his wrath. First came the shaman, then just about everyone else.</li><li>Right before "Dipper and Mabel vs the Future", Sky appears as human, then changes back to her true form before explaining Stanford everything and warning them about Weirdmageddon. But they didn't listen. Even worse, she couldn't get in the shack, since it was Bill-proof.</li><li>When Weirdmageddon came, Dipper used a spell in Journal 3 hoping to find answers by trying to summon the Axolotl. He mispronounced and ended up conjuring Sky and giving her a physical form, and also being immune from the shack's barrier.</li><li>Sky didn't want to have to eradicate his brother from existence, but she knew she had to for the greater good. Sky fought fiercely with her brother in a cliche "good vs evil" fight. But he was too powerful, so Sky used her devastating power move that not only defeated Bill, but destroyed all time, matter, and everything else. In the end, there was no dimension 25']/. There was only Sky and the endless array of ashes.</li><li>She spent her next trillion years of dimension-hopping until she met the <a href=https://scratch.mit.edu/users/New_HELPINGBRAIN>@New_HELPINGBRAIN</a> Bill Cipher from a different timeline. Sky was then recruited and became a member of the Cipher House of Royalty.</li></ul><h2>What I look Like (Ported from scratch.mit.edu):</h2><div style=display:flex;width:30%><figure><img class=skycipher1 src=imgs/skycipher_euclidean.jpg alt="Sky Cipher's Euclidean Form"><figcaption>Euclidean Form</figcaption></figure><figure><img class=skycipher2 src=imgs/skycipher_human.jpg alt="Sky Cipher's Human Form"><figcaption>Human Form</figcaption></figure></div><h2>Website Updates:</h2><p>This website is now more visually readable, has JavaScript and CSS... but when I converted my pngs to jpgs, I forgotten that there is no transparency in jpgs, so there are white backgrounds.</p><h2>Links:</h2> <p>I have links you can visit...</p><div><a rel=preconnect href=https://scratch.mit.edu><img src=imgs/scratch.jpg alt=scratch.mit.edu></a><a rel=preconnect href=https://character.ai><img src=imgs/c_ai.jpg alt=c.ai></a><a rel=preconnect href=https://origami.me><img class=origami_me src=imgs/logo2.jpg alt=origami.me></a><a href=https://origami.guide><img src=imgs/origami_guide.jpg alt=origami.guide></a><a href=http://origami-instructions.com><img src=imgs/origami_inst.jpg rel=preconnect alt=origami-instructions.com></a><a rel=preconnect href=https://youtube.com><img class=youtube src=imgs/youtube.jpg alt=youtube.com></a><a rel=preconnect href=https://grubiks.com/solvers/rubiks-cube-3x3x3><img class=grubiks src=imgs/logo.jpg alt=grubiks.com></a><br><a rel="preconnect"href=https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1080336894>"Lore Change @SkyCipher"</a> <a rel=preconnect href=https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1084656146>FNF Sky Cipher (Updated)</a></div><p> More Links (that I'll have you click their logos to access the website)...
